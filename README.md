Online Fraud Detection
A machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent online transactions. This project uses various classification algorithms to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate based on transaction features.


📂 Repository Overview
Notebook: Online_Fraud__detection.ipynb

Goal: Build and evaluate machine learning models for online fraud detection.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
